# Reviews Carousel App

I built this simple **reviews carousel app** as part of my ongoing practice with JavaScript fundamentals. The main goal was to get more comfortable working with the DOM and handling user interaction through buttons.

## 🚀 What I Built

This app allows users to browse through a list of user reviews. You can:

- View details like the reviewer's name, job, image, and a short bio.
- Navigate between reviews using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- Click a **"Surprise Me"** button to show a random review.

## 🛠️ What I Used

- **HTML** for structuring the page
- **CSS** for styling the layout (linked externally in `styles.css`)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for all the interactivity (`app.js`)

## 🧠 Concepts I Practiced

- DOM manipulation using `getElementById` and `querySelector`
- Handling events with `addEventListener`
- Looping through data with arrays
- Dynamically updating the UI based on JavaScript data
- Creating reusable functions (like for showing a person or generating a random index)

## 💡 My Thoughts

This was a great way to reinforce the basics. It helped me better understand how to:

- Dynamically inject content into the DOM
- Respond to user input with logic
- Use arrays of objects as a data source

Eventually, I might expand on this by integrating API data or adding some animations, but for now it’s a clean, functional app that gave me a good grasp of essential JavaScript skills.
